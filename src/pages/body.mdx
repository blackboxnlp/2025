### Yonatan Belinkov
Yonatan Belinkov is an assistant professor at the Technion. 
He has previously been a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard and MIT.
His recent research focuses on interpretability and robustness of neural network models of language. 
His research has been published at leading NLP and ML venues. 
His PhD dissertation at MIT analyzed internal language representations in deep learning models.
He has been awarded the Harvard Mind, Brain, and Behavior Postdoctoral Fellowship and the Azrieli Early Career Faculty Fellowship.
He co-organised BlackboxNLP in 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as the 1st and 2nd machine translation robustness tasks at WMT.

### Najoung Kim
Najoung Kim is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Linguistics at Boston University. She is currently visting Google Research part-time. She is interested in studying meaning in both human and machine learners, especially ways in which they generalize to novel inputs and ways in which they treat implicit meaning. Her research has been published in various NLP venues including ACL and EMNLP. She was a co-organizer of the Inverse Scaling Competition, and a senior area chair for ACL 2023.

### Jaap Jumelet
Jaap Jumelet is a PhD candidate at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. His research focuses on gaining an understanding of how neural models are able to build up hierarchical representations of their input, by leveraging hypotheses from (psycho-)linguistics. His research has been published at leading NLP venues, including TACL, ACL, and CoNLL. His first ever paper was presented at the first BlackboxNLP workshop in 2018, and he has since presented work at each subsequent edition of the workshop. 

### Hosein Mohebbi
Hosein Mohebbi is a PhD candidate at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University, Netherlands. He is part of the InDeep consortium project, doing research on the interpretability of deep neural models for text and speech. His research has been published in leading NLP venues such as ACL, EACL, and EMNLP, where he also regularly serves as a reviewer. He received an Outstanding Paper Award at EMNLP 2023. His contribution to the CL community extends to co-organizing the previous edition of BlackboxNLP and offering a tutorial at EACL 2024 conference.

### Aaron Mueller
Aaron Mueller is a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University and the Technion. He recently obtained his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 2023. His work takes inspiration from psycholinguistics and causal interpretability to evaluate and improve the robustness and mechanistic reasoning of NLP systems. His work has been published at leading NLP venues including ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL. He has received the Zuckerman postdoctoral fellowship, and coverage in the New York Times as a co-organizer of the BabyLM Challenge.

### Hanjie Chen
Hanjie Chen is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. She currently works as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University. She obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 2023 at the University of Virginia. Hanjie is broadly interested in Trustworthy AI, Natural Language Processing, and Interpretable Machine Learning. Specifically, her research focuses on the interpretability and analysis of neural language models. She has published papers at leading AI/NLP venues, including ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, and NAACL. She has been honored with the Outstanding Doctoral Student Award, John A. Stankovic Graduate Research Award, Carlos and Esther Farrar Fellowship, and Graduate Teaching Awards at UVA. She also won the Best Poster Award at the ACM Capital Region Celebration of Women in Computing.
